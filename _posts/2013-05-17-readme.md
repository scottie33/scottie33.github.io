to get the newest version:

    wget https://github.com/scottie33/amorphous_polymer_lammps/archive/master.zip 

HINT: just hit any command mentioned above in the command line to see 'how to' ~

\[currently dir **oneNP** will show you a protocol of a huge NP (scaled as the RG of ea. polymer) with polymers.\]

----

pre-run: 

\[goto 3\]*1*, lmp2pdb.py data.data (generate .psf and .pdb for post-processing)

\[don't use this when system's compressed too much\]*2*, after .dcd loaded by vmd: source doit.tcl

3, protocol to initialization of the system:

    a: random-NP.py | cubic-NP.py (revise it mannually)
    [before mc_gen, please delete NP.dat if there's no NanoParticle in your system]
    b: mc_gen.bash [make_mc_gen.x] [mc_gen] (revise .input whenever needed)
    c: makepair001.py | makepair_expand.py

mv pairfile **pairfile_rep** (do all the repel for minimization)

mv pairfile **pairfile_no_soft** (for the rest of the protocol, please do not ask why...)

----

run:

1, runlist.bash

post-run:

you can use the following cli to see your data-fig:

1, read the logfile:

    readlog.py

NOTE: for the \[keyword\], we shall set it the 1st keyword of dump keywords in your .log file, normally "Step"
